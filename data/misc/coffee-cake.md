Make the coffee sponge
- Pre-heat your oven to 160ºC/140ºC fan.
- Put all of the cake ingredients into a large bowl (3 tbsp coffee powder, the flour, 220g soft light brown sugar, 220g margarine or butter, 4 medium eggs, 2 tsp milk, ⅛ tsp salt). 
- Beat with an electric mixer or by hand on a low speed until all of the ingredients are combined. 
- Split the mixture between the two prepared tins. Then bake for 30-35 minutes (test if it wobbles, I had to do 40 and raise temperature a little bit at end) until a skewer (wooden chopstick) inserted in the centre comes out clean.
- Once the cakes are cooked, remove them from the oven. Leave them to cool in their tins for about 10 minutes before removing them from the tins and moving them to a wire rack to cool completely.

Make the coffee buttercream
- If not enough butter, weigh remaining butter, divide it by 200g and multiply icing and coffee by that factor
- While the cakes are cooling make the coffee buttercream. Start by mixing together the instant coffee powder/granules (8 tsp) with the boiling water (4 tsp). Set aside to cool.
- In a large bowl beat (with spoon) the butter (200g) and vanilla extract (¼ tsp). Add the icing sugar (400g) and beat on a low speed until combined with the butter and smooth. 
- Gradually add the coffee mixture, 1 tsp at a time. After each addition beat the buttercream until the coffee has been fully combined before adding more.
- Check the consistency of your buttercream. It should be soft enough that you could spread it onto a slice of bread. If it is too firm, then add a TINY touch of milk (no more than 1/2 tsp at a time) until it is your desired consistency.
